MIHCrypto
=========

MIHCrypto is an Objective-C wrapper for the cryptography core library `libCrypto` of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).


### What is OpenSSL?

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is the most powerful SSL and TLS library available which wraps a full cryptographic library. The library is written in pure C and due to its endless size and not-so-well-designed it is very hard for beginners to step into it.


### What is MIHCrypto?

The aim of the MIHCrypto library is to provide an object-oriented interface which allows developers to write simple and clean code by still using the power of the OpenSSL library. As already mentioned OpenSSL is a very large library so (yet) not the whole library is wrapped by MIHCrypto. Since [I](http://www.michaelhohl.net/) am developing the library because personal needs focus of the functionallity is on modern cryptographic apporaches, but everybody is welcome to contrbute other parts to the library.
